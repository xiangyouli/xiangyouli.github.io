Dr. Li received his Ph.D. in Physical Electronics from [[Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST)]](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2005. From 2009 to 2011, he worked as a JSPS Fellow at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Japan. He is currently a Research Professor at the **[[Wuhan National Laboratory for Optoelectronics]](https://wnlo.hust.edu.cn/)**, Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

His research focuses on **laser additive manufacturing (3D printing), laser micro/nano fabrication, and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)**. In recent years, he has made significant contributions to the development of integrated spectroscopy analysis systems, real-time detection algorithms, and intelligent control software. His team has developed a series of proprietary instruments and software platforms for elemental analysis and laser processing, which have been successfully applied in aerospace and microelectronics industries.

Dr. Li has published over 200 scientific papers, including more than 100 as first or corresponding author in SCI-indexed journals. He holds over 70 granted Chinese invention patents, several U.S. patents, and multiple software copyrights. His research achievements have been recognized with the National Science and Technology Progress Award and other provincial-level honors, and featured in major national media outlets such as Xinhua News and People’s Daily.
